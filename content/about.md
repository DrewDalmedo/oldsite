# About This Site

This site is primarily a personal site created for whatever thoughts and projects I want to talk about. I'll periodically upload new content whenever I have something interesting to discuss, such as a project I worked on at university or an open source project outside of it. I may also upload posts discussing sociological issues and whatever else may be on my mind.

### A bit about me <a name="about-me">

I'm currently an undergrad CS student at NJIT. I have over 8 years of personal experience developing software with languages ranging from Java, Python, C++, and C. I've also dabbled a bit in learning languages such as Rust and Go, although I haven't found a particular use case for them quite yet. 

### Recommended hardware <a name="hardware" >

I cannot in good faith recommend anything other than two brands of laptops: **ThinkPads and MacBooks**.

I understand that there are different needs for different people, but no other laptops have quite filled the needs that these two brands have successfully done for me in the past. Currently, I'm using a MacBook Pro 2019 13". The primary reason for this is because of the experience which macOS provides (see [recommended software](#software) for more details), in that it gets the hell out of my way and allows me to do the work that I need to get done. In addition to the OS, I cannot praise the experience which using a MacBook provides enough: it's a well built, lightweight laptop which has enough processing power to get whatever I throw at it done. Granted, I'm not really gaming all that much anymore, and I'm sure that when it comes to gaming, the integrated graphics on this thing wouldn't hold up all that well. Still, I value the portability and efficiency of the laptop more than the gaming capabilities of it, so I don't really mind all that much.

### Recommended software <a name="software" >

I'm always looking to streamline and minimize my software usage and workflows. Because of this, I constantly experiment and play around with new, minimal software that gets out of the way of it's users. Currently, my workflow incorporates the following software:

1. **macOS:** the foundation. A perfect UNIX-like environment for getting work done.
2. **Vim / MacVim:** the perfect editor. Well, maybe not "perfect," but it suits my needs just fine. After you get used to moving around and working within it, it's hard to use anything else. I have a custom configuration I'll make a post on later.
3. **NetNewsWire:** an amazing (and free!) RSS reader. It's helped me move away from social media while still retaining the ability to keep up to date with the people / blogs I want to hear more from.
